# Firebase Permissions Issues - Fix Summary

**Date**: October 19, 2025  
**Status**: âœ… RULES UPDATED & READY FOR DEPLOYMENT

---

## Issue 1: Firestore Permissions Error

### Root Cause
The Firestore security rules were missing definitions for 11 collections that the application uses:
- `game_genres`
- `event_registrations`
- `event_notifications`
- `points_multipliers`
- `store_credit_multipliers`
- `shop_products`
- `shop_orders`
- `pickup_queue`
- `role_change_logs`
- `message_notifications`
- `tournament_messages`

Additionally, the `hasRole()` function could fail if a user document didn't have a `roles` field, causing "Missing or insufficient permissions" errors.

### Fixes Applied

#### 1. Fixed `hasRole()` Function
**Before**:
```typescript
function hasRole(role) {
  return isAuthenticated() &&
         get(/databases/$(database)/documents/users/$(request.auth.uid)).data.roles.hasAny([role]);
}
```

**After**:
```typescript
function hasRole(role) {
  return isAuthenticated() &&
         get(/databases/$(database)/documents/users/$(request.auth.uid)).data.get('roles', []).hasAny([role]);
}
```

**Why**: Uses `.get('roles', [])` to safely access the roles field with a default empty array if it doesn't exist.

#### 2. Added Missing Collections
Added security rules for all 11 missing collections with appropriate permissions:

**game_genres**: Public read, admin write
**event_registrations**: User-specific read/write, admin override
**event_notifications**: User-specific read/write, system create
**points_multipliers**: Public read, admin write
**store_credit_multipliers**: Public read, admin write
**shop_products**: Public read, admin write
**shop_orders**: User-specific read/write, admin override
**pickup_queue**: User-specific read/write, admin override
**role_change_logs**: Admin read, system create, admin update/delete
**message_notifications**: User-specific read/write, system create
**tournament_messages**: Public read, authenticated create, user/admin update/delete

## Issue 2: Image Upload Button Not Working

### Root Cause
The Firebase Storage rules were already correctly configured, but they needed to be deployed to Firebase.

### Current Storage Rules Status
âœ… **VERIFIED CORRECT**

The storage.rules file has proper rules for:
- User avatars (max 5MB)
- Profile banners (max 10MB)
- Product images
- Tournament images
- Event images
- Announcement images
- General images

All rules properly check:
- User authentication
- File type (must be image)
- File size limits
- Proper path matching

## Deployment Instructions

### Option 1: Using Firebase CLI (Recommended)

```bash
# Navigate to project directory
cd "C:/Users/haley/Desktop/Belhaven Files (Classes)/Personal Projects/BUG Website/BUG-Official"

# Deploy Firestore rules
firebase deploy --only firestore:rules

# Deploy Storage rules
firebase deploy --only storage

# Or deploy both at once
firebase deploy --only firestore:rules,storage
```

### Option 2: Using Firebase Console

1. **For Firestore Rules**:
   - Go to Firebase Console â†’ Firestore Database â†’ Rules
   - Copy content from `firestore.rules` file
   - Paste into the rules editor
   - Click "Publish"

2. **For Storage Rules**:
   - Go to Firebase Console â†’ Storage â†’ Rules
   - Copy content from `storage.rules` file
   - Paste into the rules editor
   - Click "Publish"

## Files Modified

### `firestore.rules`
- Fixed `hasRole()` function to safely access roles field
- Added 11 missing collection rules
- Total lines: 601 (was 456)

### `storage.rules`
- No changes needed (already correct)
- Total lines: 92

## Testing After Deployment

### Test 1: Dashboard Page
1. Navigate to http://localhost:3001/dashboard
2. Verify page loads without "Missing or insufficient permissions" error
3. Check browser console for any Firebase errors

### Test 2: Profile Edit Page
1. Navigate to http://localhost:3001/profile/edit
2. Click "Upload Avatar" button
3. Select a JPEG or PNG image (< 5MB)
4. Verify upload completes successfully
5. Confirm avatar displays in profile

### Test 3: Profile Banner Upload
1. On profile edit page, click "Upload Banner" button
2. Select a JPEG or PNG image (< 10MB)
3. Verify upload completes successfully
4. Confirm banner displays in profile

### Test 4: Admin Pages
1. Navigate to http://localhost:3001/admin
2. Test each admin tab (Games, Store Settings, etc.)
3. Verify no permission errors appear
