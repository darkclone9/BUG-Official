## What is Store Credit?

Store credit is BUG Gaming Club's reward system that lets you earn money towards shop purchases by participating in club activities.

### Key Features:
- ✅ **Direct Dollar Value** - $1.00 credit = $1.00 off your purchase
- ✅ **No Expiration** - Your credit never expires
- ✅ **Easy to Understand** - No complex point conversions
- ✅ **Flexible** - Use as much or as little as you want

### What Happened to Points?

We've upgraded from the old points system to store credit! If you had points before, they've been automatically converted:

**Conversion Rate:** 200 points = $1.00 store credit

*Example: If you had 1,000 points, you now have $5.00 in store credit.*
