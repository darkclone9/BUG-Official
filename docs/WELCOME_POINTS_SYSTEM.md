## üéØ Features

### **Automatic Point Awards**
- Points are automatically awarded when new users sign up
- Works for both email/password and Google sign-in
- No manual intervention required

### **Flexible Promotion Configuration**
- Set custom point amounts (e.g., 1500 points)
- Limit to first N users (e.g., first 100 users)
- Set start and end dates
- Activate/deactivate promotions anytime

### **Tracking & Analytics**
- Track how many users have received the bonus

- See recipient numbers (1st, 2nd, 3rd... 100th user)
- Monitor promotion progress in real-time

### **Safety Features**

## üìù How It Works

### **1. Admin Creates Promotion**
```typescript
{
  name: "First 100 Users Bonus",
  description: "Welcome bonus for our first 100 members!",
  pointsAmount: 1500,
  maxUsers: 100,
  startDate: new Date('2025-01-01'),
  endDate: new Date('2025-12-31'), // Optional
  isActive: true
}
```

### **2. User Signs Up**
- User creates account via email/password or Google
- System checks for active promotion
- If eligible, points are automatically awarded
- User sees their points balance immediately

### **3. Points Are Awarded**
- User receives the specified points (e.g., 1500)
- Points transaction is recorded
- Recipient record is created
- Promotion counter is incremented

### **4. Promotion Fills Up**
- When 100 users have received points, promotion stops accepting new recipients
- Admin can view all recipients and their details
- Promotion can be deactivated manually anytime

## üóÇÔ∏è Database Structure

### **Collections Created**

#### **`welcome_points_promotions`**
Stores promotion configurations:
```typescript
{
  id: string;
  name: string;
  description: string;
  pointsAmount: number;        // e.g., 1500
  startDate: Date;
  endDate?: Date;
  maxUsers: number;            // e.g., 100
  currentCount: number;        // How many have received
  isActive: boolean;
  createdAt: Date;
  createdBy: string;           // Admin UID
  updatedAt: Date;
}
```

#### **`welcome_points_recipients`**
Tracks who received the bonus:
```typescript
{
  id: string;
  promotionId: string;
  userId: string;
  userEmail: string;
  userDisplayName: string;
  pointsAwarded: number;
  awardedAt: Date;
  recipientNumber: number;     // 1st, 2nd, 3rd... user
}
```

- Works across all promotions

### **Error Handling**
