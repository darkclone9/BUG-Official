## üìä Tab 1: Points Multiplier Campaigns

### **What It Does**
Multiplies points earned during specific periods to encourage user participation in events and activities.

### **Use Cases**
- **Double Points Weekend** - 2x points for all activities
- **Holiday Bonus** - 1.5x points during holidays
- **Event Boost** - 3x points for event attendance
- **Volunteer Appreciation** - 2x points for volunteer work

### **How to Create a Multiplier Campaign**

1. Click **"Create Campaign"** button
2. Fill in the form:
   - **Campaign Name** - e.g., "Double Points Weekend"
   - **Description** - Explain the campaign
   - **Multiplier** - Enter value (e.g., 2.0 for double points)
   - **Start Date** - When campaign begins
   - **End Date** - When campaign ends
   - **Applicable Categories** - Select which activities get multiplied:
     - Event Attendance
     - Volunteer Work
     - Event Hosting
     - Contribution
   - **Active** - Toggle to activate/deactivate
3. Click **"Create Campaign"**

### **Campaign Details**

Each campaign card shows:
- **Status Badge** - "Active Now" (green) or "Inactive" (gray)
- **Multiplier Value** - e.g., "2.0x"
- **Date Range** - Start and end dates
- **Categories** - Which activities are affected
- **Actions** - Edit, Activate/Deactivate, Delete

### **How It Works**

When a user earns points during an active campaign:
1. System checks if current date is within campaign dates
2. System checks if the points category matches campaign categories
3. If both match, points are multiplied by the campaign multiplier
4. User receives the multiplied amount

**Example:**
- User attends event (normally 50 points)
- "Double Points Weekend" is active (2.0x multiplier)
- User receives 100 points instead

### **How It Works**

When a new user signs up:
