## 🔍 Browser Console Logs

When uploading, you should see:
```
Starting avatar upload for user: {userId}
File details: { name: "...", size: ..., type: "image/..." }
Uploading file to Cloudinary...
File uploaded successfully: https://res.cloudinary.com/...
Updating user document with avatar URL...
User document updated successfully
```

## ⚠️ Troubleshooting

### If upload fails with "Upload preset not found":
- ✅ FIXED - We removed the preset requirement

### If upload fails with "api_key not found":
1. Verify `.env.local` has `NEXT_PUBLIC_CLOUDINARY_API_KEY`
2. Restart dev server: `npm run dev`
3. Try upload again

### If upload fails with "Invalid cloud name":
1. Verify `.env.local` has correct `NEXT_PUBLIC_CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME`
2. Should be: `djowsskks`
3. Restart dev server

### If image doesn't display:
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Verify Cloudinary URL is correct
3. Check Firestore document was updated
4. Verify image exists in Cloudinary Media Library

### If timeout error occurs:
1. Check file size (< 5MB for avatar, < 10MB for banner)
2. Check internet connection
3. Try again (may be temporary network issue)
