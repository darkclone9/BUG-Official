This guide will walk you through setting up the BUG Gaming Club shop system from start to finish.

## ‚úÖ Prerequisites Checklist

Before starting, make sure you have:

- [x] Stripe API keys added to `.env.local`
- [ ] Firestore security rules deployed
- [ ] Firestore indexes created
- [ ] Stripe webhook configured
- [ ] First product added

---

## Step 1: Deploy Firestore Security Rules

### Option A: Using Firebase Console (Recommended for Beginners)

1. **Open Firebase Console**
   - Go to https://console.firebase.google.com
   - Select your project: `bug-96c26`

2. **Navigate to Firestore Rules**
   - Click "Firestore Database" in the left sidebar
   - Click the "Rules" tab at the top

3. **Copy and Paste Rules**
   - Open the `firestore.rules` file in your project
   - Copy ALL the content
   - Paste it into the Firebase Console rules editor
   - Click "Publish"

4. **Verify Deployment**
   - You should see a success message
   - The rules are now active!

### Option B: Using Firebase CLI (Advanced)

```bash
# Install Firebase CLI (if not already installed)
npm install -g firebase-tools

# Login to Firebase
firebase login

# Initialize Firebase in your project (if not already done)
firebase init firestore

# Deploy rules
firebase deploy --only firestore:rules
```

---

## Step 2: Create Firestore Indexes

Firestore requires indexes for complex queries. You need to create these manually.

### Method 1: Automatic (Let Firebase Create Them)

1. **Try to load the shop page** at http://localhost:3000/shop
2. **Check the browser console** for error messages
3. **Click the index creation link** in the error message
4. Firebase will automatically create the required index

### Method 2: Manual Creation

1. **Go to Firebase Console** > Firestore Database > Indexes tab

2. **Create these indexes:**

#### Index 1: Shop Products (Active + Created)
- **Collection ID:** `shop_products`
- **Fields:**
  - `active` (Ascending)
  - `createdAt` (Descending)
- **Query scope:** Collection

#### Index 2: Shop Products (Category + Created)
- **Collection ID:** `shop_products`
- **Fields:**
  - `category` (Ascending)
  - `createdAt` (Descending)
- **Query scope:** Collection

#### Index 3: Shop Orders (User + Created)
- **Collection ID:** `shop_orders`
- **Fields:**
  - `userId` (Ascending)
  - `createdAt` (Descending)
- **Query scope:** Collection

#### Index 4: Shop Orders (Status + Created)
- **Collection ID:** `shop_orders`
- **Fields:**
  - `status` (Ascending)
  - `createdAt` (Descending)
- **Query scope:** Collection

3. **Wait for indexes to build** (usually takes 1-5 minutes)

---

## Step 3: Configure Stripe Webhook

You already have Stripe CLI installed! Now let's get the webhook secret.

### Get Webhook Secret

1. **Open a NEW PowerShell window** (keep your dev server running in the other one)

2. **Navigate to your project:**
   ```powershell
   cd "C:\Users\haley\Desktop\Belhaven Files (Classes)\Personal Projects\BUG Website\BUG-Official"
   ```

3. **Login to Stripe** (if not already logged in):
   ```powershell
   stripe login
   ```
   - A browser window will open
   - Click "Allow access"
   - Wait for confirmation

4. **Start webhook listener:**
   ```powershell
   stripe listen --forward-to localhost:3000/api/webhooks/stripe
   ```

5. **Copy the webhook secret:**
   - Look for this line in the output:
     ```
     > Ready! Your webhook signing secret is whsec_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
     ```
   - Copy the `whsec_...` value

6. **Update `.env.local`:**
   - Open `.env.local`
   - Replace `whsec_YOUR_WEBHOOK_SECRET_HERE` with your actual secret
   - Save the file

7. **Restart your dev server:**
   - Stop the server (Ctrl+C in the terminal running `npm run dev`)
   - Start it again: `npm run dev`

8. **Keep the webhook listener running!**
   - Leave the `stripe listen` command running in the background
   - This forwards Stripe events to your local server
