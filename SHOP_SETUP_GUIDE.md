### 2. Firestore Setup

6. **shop_orders** - Order history
7. **pickup_queue** - Campus pickup management
8. **role_change_logs** - Audit trail

#### Firestore Indexes

Add these composite indexes to `firestore.indexes.json`:

```json
{
  "indexes": [
    {
      "collectionGroup": "points_transactions",
      "queryScope": "COLLECTION",
      "fields": [
        { "fieldPath": "userId", "order": "ASCENDING" },
        { "fieldPath": "createdAt", "order": "DESCENDING" }
      ]
    },
    {
      "collectionGroup": "points_transactions",
      "queryScope": "COLLECTION",
      "fields": [
        { "fieldPath": "status", "order": "ASCENDING" },
        { "fieldPath": "createdAt", "order": "DESCENDING" }
      ]
    },
    {
      "collectionGroup": "shop_orders",
      "queryScope": "COLLECTION",
      "fields": [
        { "fieldPath": "userId", "order": "ASCENDING" },
        { "fieldPath": "createdAt", "order": "DESCENDING" }
      ]
    },
    {
      "collectionGroup": "shop_orders",
      "queryScope": "COLLECTION",
      "fields": [
        { "fieldPath": "status", "order": "ASCENDING" },
        { "fieldPath": "createdAt", "order": "DESCENDING" }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

Deploy indexes:
```bash
firebase deploy --only firestore:indexes
```

Cart:
- T-Shirt: $20.00
- Sticker: $5.00
Subtotal: $25.00

User has 15,000 points available
User applies 15,000 points

Calculation:
- T-Shirt: $20.00 ‚Üí 50% cap = $10.00 max discount
- Sticker: $5.00 ‚Üí 50% cap = $2.50 max discount
- Total possible discount: $12.50
- Points needed: 12,500 points
- Points used: 12,500 points

Final:
- Subtotal: $25.00
